I am currently seeking for a job in Python Software Development in London,
and it was really long to send a mail to each Python Developer from GitHub 
living in London, so I made this little program, which will allow you to see 
my python skills.


Dependencies:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - python 2.6
 - mechanize
 - pyquery
 - termcolor


To do:
~~~~~~
 - Send a mail to each developer from the list


How to use:
~~~~~~~~~~~
 $ python github_bot.py
