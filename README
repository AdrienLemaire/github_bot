I am currently seeking for a job in Python Software Development in London,
and it was really long to send a mail to each Python Developer from GitHub 
living in London, so I made this little program, which will allow you to see 
my python skills.


Dependencies:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - python 2.6
 - mechanize
 - pyquery
 - termcolor


How to use:
~~~~~~~~~~~
 $ python github_bot.py



To do:
~~~~~~
You can easily adapt this program to your needs, but if you want me to make it
more user friendly (catch argvs for example), just ask, and I'll spend a few
time to adapt it.
